1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Developer settings > Personal access tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token (classic)"

5. Choose your branch (usually `main` or `master`)
6. Click "Test Configuration" to verify everything works

### 4. Initialize Repository
- Click "Initialize Repository" to set up Git in your vault
- If your vault is empty, it will clone your existing repository
- If your vault has notes, it will create a new repository and push your files

### 5. Start Syncing
- That's it! Your notes will now sync automatically
- Use "Sync Now" command for manual syncing
- Check "View Pending Changes" to see what will be synced

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration Options

### Auto-Sync Settings
- **Enable Auto-sync** - Toggle automatic background syncing
- **Sync Interval** - Set how often to sync (1-60 minutes)
- **Auto-pull on startup** - Fetch updates when opening Obsidian

### Selective Sync
Exclude files and folders from syncing using patterns:
```
.obsidian/**     # Obsidian configuration files
.trash/**        # Deleted files
private/**       # Private folders
*.tmp            # Temporary files
```

### Advanced Options
- **Branch selection** - Choose which Git branch to sync
- **Commit messages** - Customize automatic commit messages
- **Conflict handling** - Configure how conflicts are resolved (Prompt, Take Latest, Always Keep Local, Always Keep Remote)

## üîÑ How It Works

### Automatic Syncing
1. **File Changes Detected** - Plugin monitors all file operations in real-time
2. **Changes Queued** - Modified files are added to an internal queue
3. **Background Sync** - At configured intervals, changes are synced to GitHub
4. **Conflict Resolution** - Any conflicts are automatically handled

### Offline Support
- **Queue Changes** - When offline, all changes are stored locally
- **Sync on Reconnect** - Once internet returns, queued changes are synced
- **Order Preservation** - Changes are applied in the correct sequence

### Conflict Handling
- **Non-overlapping Changes** - Automatically merged when possible
- **True Conflicts** - Both versions saved with conflict markers
- **User Notification** - Clear alerts when manual review is needed (unless you choose automatic resolution)
- **Data Safety** - No content is ever lost during conflicts
- **Configurable Strategy** - Choose to always take the latest, always keep local, always keep remote, or be prompted for each conflict

## üìã Commands

Access these commands via the Command Palette (Ctrl/Cmd + P):

- **Sync Now** - Manually trigger an immediate sync
- **View Pending Changes** - See what files are queued for sync
- **Initialize Repository** - Set up Git repository in current vault

## üîí Security & Privacy

### Data Security
- **Your data stays yours** - Notes remain in your private GitHub repository
- **Token security** - Access tokens stored locally on your devices only
- **HTTPS only** - All communication encrypted via HTTPS
- **Limited scope** - Tokens only need repository access

### Privacy Best Practices
- Use a **private repository** for your notes
- **Review and rotate** access tokens periodically
- **Revoke tokens** if a device is lost or compromised
- **Limit token scope** to only necessary permissions

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Sync Fails**
- Check your internet connection
- Verify your GitHub token hasn't expired
- Ensure repository URL is correct

**Conflicts**
- Look for files with "_conflict" in the name
- Open conflicted files to review differences
- Merge manually and sync again

**Mobile Performance**
- Reduce sync frequency if experiencing slowness
- Use selective sync to exclude large folders
- Restart Obsidian if sync gets stuck

- Check the plugin logs in developer console
- Review GitHub repository for known issues
- Create an issue with detailed error information
