## 🎯 How to Use Like a Pro

### 📊 **Start with Sync Plan**
Before any major sync operation:
1. Run **"📊 Show Sync Plan"** command
2. Review what will be uploaded/downloaded
3. Check for conflicts that need resolution
4. Click "Execute Sync" when ready

### 🔍 **Regular Vault Scanning**
Run **"🔍 Scan Vault for Changes"** regularly to:
- Detect files you've added outside Obsidian
- Find files that weren't tracked automatically
- Ensure comprehensive sync coverage

### 📋 **Monitor Pending Changes**
Use **"📋 View Pending Changes"** to:
- See what's queued for next sync
- Review files before they're uploaded
- Cancel individual file changes if needed

### 🧠 **Smart Sync for Conflicts**
When you have conflicts:
1. Use **"🧠 Smart Sync"** for automatic resolution
2. Or use **"📊 Show Sync Plan"** to review conflicts manually
3. Choose your conflict resolution strategy in settings

## ⚙️ Advanced Configuration

### 🎯 **Selective Sync Patterns**
Exclude files and folders using these patterns in settings:

```
.obsidian/workspace*     # Workspace files (device-specific)
.obsidian/app.json       # App settings
.trash/**                # Deleted files folder
Private/**               # Private folders
*.tmp                    # Temporary files
**/.DS_Store            # macOS system files
**/Thumbs.db            # Windows system files
```

### 🌿 **Branch Strategy**
- **main** - Your primary notes branch
- **mobile** - Separate branch for mobile-only notes
- **work** - Work-related notes branch
- **archive** - Old notes you want to keep separate

### 🔄 **Auto-Sync Best Practices**
- **Frequent syncing** (5-10 minutes) for active collaboration
- **Less frequent** (30-60 minutes) for personal use
- **Disable auto-sync** when working offline extensively
- **Manual sync** before important meetings or presentations

## 🔍 Understanding Sync Operations

### ⬆️ **Upload Operations (Local → Remote)**
- Files that exist only on your device
- Files that are newer locally than remotely
- New notes you've created
- Modified existing notes

### ⬇️ **Download Operations (Remote → Local)**
- Files that exist only on GitHub
- Files that are newer remotely than locally
- Notes created on other devices
- Changes from other people (if sharing)

### ⚠️ **Conflict Resolution**
When the same file is modified in both places:
- **Prompt**: Ask you what to do each time
- **Latest**: Use whichever version was modified most recently
- **Local**: Always keep your local version (upload it)
- **Remote**: Always use the remote version (download it)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Guide

### 🚨 **Common Issues & Solutions**

#### **"GitHub token in wrong field" Error**
**Problem**: You put your token in Repository URL field
**Solution**: 
1. Repository URL: `https://github.com/username/repo`
2. GitHub Token: `ghp_xxxxxxxxxxxxx`

#### **"404 errors when pulling" Error**
**Problem**: Trying to download files that don't exist yet
**Solution**: Start with "Push All Local Files" to upload your notes first

#### **"Auto-sync restart loops" Error**
**Problem**: Settings changes triggering infinite restarts
**Solution**: 
1. Disable auto-sync temporarily
2. Configure all settings
3. Re-enable auto-sync when done

#### **"Files not syncing" Problem**
**Problem**: Only touched files sync, not everything
**Solution**: This is fixed! Use these commands:
1. **"🔍 Scan Vault for Changes"** - Detects all files
2. **"📊 Show Sync Plan"** - Shows what will sync
3. **"🚀 Execute Sync"** - Syncs everything missing

#### **Mobile Performance Issues**
**Solutions**:
- Reduce auto-sync frequency (30+ minutes)
- Use selective sync to exclude large folders
- Restart Obsidian if sync gets stuck
- Check available storage space

#### **Sync Gets Stuck**
**Solutions**:
1. Check internet connection
2. Verify GitHub token hasn't expired
3. Use **"📜 View Sync History"** to see error details
4. Restart auto-sync with toggle command
5. Try manual sync with **"🔄 Full Sync"**

### 🔧 **Advanced Troubleshooting**

#### **Reset Everything**
If things go wrong:
1. Disable auto-sync
2. Clear all settings in plugin config
3. Re-enter repository URL and token
4. Run **"🔍 Scan Vault for Changes"**
5. Use **"📊 Show Sync Plan"** to review
6. Re-enable auto-sync

#### **Token Permissions**
Your GitHub token needs:
- ✅ **repo** scope (full repository access)
- ✅ **private repo** access if using private repository
- ❌ No other scopes needed

#### **Network Issues**
- Use HTTPS repository URLs only
- Check firewall settings on corporate networks
- Verify GitHub isn't blocked
- Try manual sync first before auto-sync

## 🔒 Security & Privacy

### 🛡️ **Data Security**
- **Your notes stay yours** - Everything stored in your private GitHub repo
- **Token security** - Tokens stored locally on devices only
- **HTTPS encryption** - All communication encrypted
- **Limited permissions** - Token only needs repository access
- **No cloud middleman** - Direct sync between your devices and GitHub

### 🔐 **Privacy Best Practices**
1. **Use private repositories** for personal notes
2. **Rotate tokens regularly** (every 6-12 months)
3. **Revoke tokens immediately** if device is lost/stolen
4. **Review repository access** periodically
5. **Use separate repos** for different types of content
6. **Enable 2FA** on your GitHub account

### 🚨 **If Something Goes Wrong**
1. **Revoke the token** immediately at [GitHub Settings](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. **Change your GitHub password** if you suspect compromise
3. **Review repository access logs** in GitHub settings
4. **Create a new token** with fresh permissions
5. **Check for unauthorized commits** in your repository history

## 🛡️ Security Considerations

Your GitHub token is stored locally in plugin settings. For maximum safety:
- Use a token with only the required scopes (`repo`, `private_repo` if needed)
- Rotate your token regularly (every 6-12 months)
- Never share your vault folder or plugin settings
- Revoke your token immediately if your device is lost or compromised

All sync operations use HTTPS and do not transmit your token to any third party. However, Obsidian plugins run in a sandbox, not a secure enclave—treat your token as sensitive.

## 🧪 Manual Test Script

1. Install the plugin and configure settings (repo URL, token, branch).
2. Create, modify, and delete notes in your vault.
3. Run all sync commands (Full Sync, Push, Pull, Smart Sync) and verify changes on GitHub.
4. Test conflict resolution by editing the same file on two devices and syncing both.
5. Enter an invalid token and confirm error handling and user feedback.
6. Try selective sync and branch switching features.
7. Review sync history and pending changes for accuracy.
